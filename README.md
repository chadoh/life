# Entire.Life

A service to quickly make an inspiring chart of your entire life, similar to [Brittany Fork's](http://brittanyforks.com/life/).

Built with [react-flux-jwt-authentication-sample](https://github.com/auth0/react-flux-jwt-authentication-sample) as a starting point, and later incorporating lots of lessons from [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/).

## Development

Run `npm install` on this project and run `npm run start` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Optionally, you can run [life_api](https://github.com/chadoh/life_api) locally on port 5000, and change `src/config.js` to use it instead of the production env.
