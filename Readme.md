# Life

A service to quickly make an inspiring chart of your entire life, similar to [Buster Benson's](http://busterbenson.com/) but with emojis on each week.

Built with [react-flux-jwt-authentication-sample](https://github.com/auth0/react-flux-jwt-authentication-sample) as a starting point.

## Development

You will need to run [life_api](https://github.com/chadoh/life_api) locally on port 3001.

Then, run `npm install` on this project and run `npm run watch` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
