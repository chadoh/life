                  Your life tells a story. Use Entire.Life to track the plot
                  twists that have lead to where you are. You can add as little
                  or as much detail as you wantâ€”even using Entire.Life as a
                  journal!

                  Add plans for next week, next year, or even your hundredth
                  birthday! Once the date of a plan has passed by, you can mark
                  it as completed, snooze it until next week, or just forget
                  all about it.

                  If you had a diamond for each week of your life, the whole
                  lot of them would fill one spoonful. Entire.Life helps keep
                  you in a zoomed-out view of your life. It's natural to feel
                  some angst about that at first, but once we get past our fear
                  of being tiny, seeing our diamonds for how vanishing and
                  finite they are can help to motivate and free us.
